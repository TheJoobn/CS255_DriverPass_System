# CS 255:  DriverPass System - Requirements and Design

          Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

**PURPOSE:**

 - The purpose of this project is to design a website system for DriverPass that offers comprehensive resources and tools to assist students in successfully passing their driver's tests.

**CLIENT:**
 - Name: Liam
 - Position: Owner
 - Company: DriverPass

**DESCRIPTION:**         
 - Liam is the owner of DriverPass and is responsible for overseeing the project and providing the vision for the system.
 - DriverPass wants the system to provide online classes and practice tests for students preparing for driving tests.
 - They aim to address the lack of effective tools available to train students for passing their driving tests by offering an online platform and training services.
 - The problem DriverPass wants to fix is the inadequacy of existing resources and tools for preparing students for driving tests.
 - They want to bridge this gap by developing a system that offers online classes and practice exams, ensuring students are well-prepared and confident when taking their driving tests.





          What did you do particularly well?

 -Although there are numerous improvements and additional details that could be incorporated, I believe I did a decent job on my graphs. I enjoyed learning and creating the graphs as well as means to organize the content within them.  
 





          If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

 - There is room for enhancing the requirements document to better meet the client's needs. During the creation of my graphs, I realized that there were additional aspects I could have included in the business requirements document. The process of constructing the graphs helped me consider and evaluate processes that I had previously overlooked.
 




          How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


 - Without a comprehensive system requirements process, there is a higher likelihood of the system deviating from the client's vision of that system. These discrepancies can encompass various aspects such as missing functions or processes, distinct interfaces, disparate layouts, and a multitude of other detailed specifications. Upon reviewing the interview transcript, I noticed a lack of information, which left the creators to interpret and make assumptions during the design stage. As I progressed with the project, I increasingly felt that an additional client interview would have been beneficial in promoting the client's vision and needs.




          How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?



 - Creating lists and taking detailed notes is my primary strategy. By documenting specific details and information, I aim to reduce confusion and enhance the development process of designs, systems, and other elements. The comprehensive nature of my notes allows for better organization and reference, aiding in the overall effectiveness of my work.

Furthermore, I recognize the value of incorporating interview strategies and thought processes learned during this course. By applying these techniques, I can gather increased relevant information during client interactions, ensuring that their needs and vision are understood and met. These strategies will prove beneficial in my future professional endeavors, enabling me to approach interviews and requirements gathering in a structured and insightful manner.


Whenever I faced roadblocks I enacted the following strategies:


 - Reviewed the provided requirments and documentation of the assignment.  This helped me regain clarity and ensured that I was on the right track.

 - Consulted my pseudocode to help identify potential errors in my code or work.  This provided valuable insight for troubleshooting.

 - Researched and explored online for approaches and solutions to the problems I was facing.  This helped me broaden my perspective and learn new strategies.  

 - Took notes on different aspects or insights that could aide me in solving the problem.

 - Created multiple other copies of my code for testing and editing. This allowed me to test and experiment different modifications without the fear of losing progress.  

 - Took periodic breaks for mental recollection and allowed me to approach roadblocks with a fresh perspective. 


By implementing these strategies, I was able to overcome obstacles and find effective solutions to the problems I encountered.
