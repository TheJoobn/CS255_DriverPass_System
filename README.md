# CS 255:  DriverPass System Requirements and Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to design a website system for DriverPass that offers comprehensive resources and tools to assist students in successfully passing their driver's tests.

•	CLIENT:

Name: Liam

Position: Owner

Company: DriverPass

Description: Liam is the owner of DriverPass and is responsible for overseeing the project and providing the vision for the system.

•	DriverPass wants the system to provide online classes and practice tests for students preparing for driving tests. They aim to address the lack of effective tools available to train students for passing their driving tests by offering an online platform and training services.

•	The problem DriverPass wants to fix is the inadequacy of existing resources and tools for preparing students for driving tests. They want to bridge this gap by developing a system that offers online classes and practice exams, ensuring students are well-prepared and confident when taking their driving tests.

**What did you do particularly well?**

o	I think I did a good job on my graphs, even though there are many improvements to be made and details to be added. I overall had a great time trying to figure out the rules of the graphs and how to go about structuring my content within them. 

        ==========================================================


**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

o	Even though I think I did good on my graphs, they can still use a lot of improvements to be functional and useable. I also could use improvement on my requirements document. While making my graphs I noticed a lot of areas where I was missing information in my business requirements document. I think doing the graphs helped me see a lot of the processes that I may have grazed over and didn’t think deeply enough about.

        ==========================================================


**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

o	Without a detailed system requirements process many aspects of the system could be different that what the client had envisioned. These differences could include missing functions/processes, different interfaces, different layouts, and many more detailed specifications that need to be collected from the client. Overall I found the interview transcript lacking in information and left the creators to do some interpretation when on to the development stages. The more I worked on it the more I felt like I could use another interview with the client to get a note of some of the specifics that would be needed to ensure the client is happy in the end.

        ==========================================================


**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

o	Creating lists and notes is my main strategy. Lately, I have been trying to capture more details in my notes to avoid confusion later and to develop better designs, systems, and other aspects with a high level of detail. Some of the interview strategies and thought processes that we learned throughout this course will also be on my list if they become applicable in my future jobs.
